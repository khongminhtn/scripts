# Weekly Report
This is a rewritten script of script-info-report, an improved version of the script to report additional information.  
 
I was motivated to write this script because of my parent's language barrier. My parents will no longer need to navigate through the browser to get information on things such as bills.  
 
It is incredibly time consuming to go through and keep track of all the upcoming payments that are due on different dates and from various companies. Instead, everything will displayed and reported in a single email every week.
